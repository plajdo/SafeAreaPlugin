### What is SafeArea?
SafeArea is a simple plugin that prevents hostile mobs from spawning in marked areas.

### Why is SafeArea there?
I'm sure every one of us has made something in Minecraft that looked better in the dark. The problem is, however, when you build it in survival mode, monsters can spawn and it becomes dangerous at night. Most players don't want to light the build up and put torches everywhere, so they end up having no other choice than to constantly deal with monsters.

 

This plugin solves this issue by allowing you to mark an area as safe, and it will prevent any hostile mobs from spawning in there. Don't worry, pigs, sheep or other friendly animals will still be able to spawn.

### Why X at the end?
A project with the same name sadly exists, but it was deprecated a long time ago, so I thought it would be okay to use this name anyways.
